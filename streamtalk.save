Contact Information: Display your contact details such as phone number, email address, and physical address (if applicable). You can also provide links 
to your social media profiles.

Contact Form: Include a form that allows users to send you a message directly from the website. The form can have fields for name, email, subject, and 
message. You can use a form library like react-hook-form or formik to handle form submission and validation.

Map: If you have a physical location or office, you can embed a map to show its location. You can use services like Google Maps or Mapbox to generate an 
embeddable map code.

Business Hours: If you have specific business hours or availability, you can mention them on the contact page. This helps users know when they can 
expect a response from you.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): If you often receive common questions from users, you can include a list of FAQs and their answers on the contact 
page. This can help address some common concerns without users needing to contact you directly.

Call to Action: Encourage users to contact you by including a clear call to action. This can be a button or a message inviting them to reach out for 
inquiries, collaborations, or any other purpose.
